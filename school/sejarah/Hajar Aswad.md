# Hajar Aswad

Hajar Aswad is a black stone.

## Origin
It is found at the side of Kaabah before [Nabi Muhammad](Nabi Muhammad.md) was born.

## Importance
Muslims that visit Kaabah are told to respect this stone. They are also recommended to kiss, touch or give signals to it. Obviously, the kissing part is optional in Islam.

## Dispute
A dispute between [Kabilah](Kabilah.md)s broke out when the stone was moved during a flood and they wanted to decide who were to restore the stone back to its original location.

They decided to let [Nabi Muhammad](Nabi Muhammad.md) be the judge. [Nabi Muhammad](Nabi Muhammad.md) resolved the dispute by placing it on a cloth and asking a representative from each [Kabilah](Kabilah.md) to pull a part of the cloth and place it back.

Everyone was happy by this outcome.
