# Agama Hanif
Agama Hanif refers to the beliefs that were passed down by the other [Nabi](Nabi.md)s before [Nabi Muhammad](Nabi Muhammad.md).

Believers of this religion are named `Hunafa`. By the end of [Arab Jahiliah](Masyarakat Arab Jahiliah.md), some "believers" have already forgotten the words of the [Nabi](Nabi.md)s and returned to the standard Masyarakat Arab Jahiliah.
