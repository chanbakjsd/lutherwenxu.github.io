# Kabilah

Kabilah is a system of living where people live in tribes without a permanent home.
Members of a tribe take the identity of their tribe very seriously.

## Organizational Layout
A tribe is lead by a leader named `Syeikh` whom is seen as the symbol of unity of a tribe.

A candidate of `Syeikh` needs to fulfill multiple requirements:
- Must be liked
- Have the agreement of the majority of a tribe
- Mature
- Brave
- Good at speaking

## Negative Consequences
The identity part of a tribe has caused a war as the members of a tribe care about their tribe a lot.
A classic example is the [al-Basus War](al-Basus War.md) where a small conflict had lead to a huge war.
