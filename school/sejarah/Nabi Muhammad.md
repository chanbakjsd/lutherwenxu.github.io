Nabi Muhammad is the person who created Islam.
He is the descendant of [Qusai bin Kilab](Qusai bin Kilab.md), a famous leader of [Makkah](Makkah.md), but is commonly associated with Hasyim, his great-grandfather.

## Name
Nabi Muhammad's full name is Muhammad bin Abdullah. Muhammad meaning commended.

## Marriage Status
Nabi Muhammad married [Khadijah](Khadijah binti Khuwailid.md) when he was 25 years old and [Khadijah](Khadijah binti Khuwailid.md) is 40 years old.

## Personality
Nabi Muhammad has four main characteristics that can be commended.

|     | Bahasa Arab | English               |
| --- | ---         | ---                   |
| 1   | siddiq      | Honest                |
| 2   | amanah      | Trustworthy           |
| 3   | tabliq      | Does what he promises |
| 4   | fatanah     | Intelligent           |

Before he became a prophet, he would sometimes question the values of [Masyarakat Arab Jahiliah](Masyarakat Arab Jahiliah.md).
To distance himself from these values, he would use the `bertahannuth` method where he worships Allah at [Gua Hirak](Gua Hirak.md) and tries to figure out how to correct these values.

### Honesty
He was named `al-Amin` by Arab Quraisy because he never lies. He was so commonly addressed as `al-Amin` that Muhammad was almost never used.

His integrity can be seen before he became a prophet. When he was 35 years old, he had resolved a dispute regarding the movement of [Hajar Aswad](Hajar Aswad.md) back to its original location (it was moved during a flood).

### Perserverence
Once chosen as a prophet, he put all his effort into spreading Islam even when he faced a lot of difficulties doing so.

### Towards Family
He is a family leader that everyone should learn from because of his loving and understanding nature. He helps [Khadijah](Khadijah binti Khuwailid.md) to cook, iron shirts, take care of children and cleans the house.
His children are given religion education and he is a role model for them. This is so that they follow him in living a moderate lifestyle.

### Humble
Even though his society standing is high, he always acts humbly. This can be seen by him interacting with all layers of the society.

### Caring
He is also caring to the elderly and the young.

### Forgiving
He has also shown his forgiving when returning to [Makkah](Makkah.md) on 630AD by forgiving the sins of those who have gave themselves up.

### Intelligent
He is also famous for his intelligence. This can be shown when he signed the [Treaty of Hudaibiyah](Treaty of Hudaibiyah.md).

## Life
### Pre-Prophet
His father, Abdullah bin Abdul Muttalib, died when his mother was still pregnant.

Nabi Muhammad was born on 570/04/20 (12 Rabiulawal).
A few days after his birth, Halimatus Sa'diyah became his babysitter.

At 6 years old, his mother, Aminah binti Wahab, died and Nabi Muhammad became an orphan.
His grandfather, Abdul Muttalib, became his guardian.
Upon Abdul Muttalib's death, his uncle, Abu Talib took over as his new guardian.

His life was full of challenges. He takes care of his uncle's sheep.
The first time he started doing commerce was when he was 12 where he went on a trip with his uncle to Syam, a place located at the north of Tanah Arab.

A Christian Priest named Buhaira has predicted the prophetization of Nabi Muhammad when they stopped by Basrah.
The priest advised Abu Talib to bring Nabi Muhammad back because he predicted that Nabi will be killed by Jews.

At the age of 20, Nabi Muhammad is very proficient in the art of trading and have traded by himself and with partners.
His uncle, however, wished for Nabi Muhammad to have a more constant source of income so he suggested Nabi Muhammad to work for [Khadijah binti Khuwailid](Khadijah binti Khuwailid.md).

When working for [Khadijah](Khadijah binti Khuwailid.md), he worked with Maisarah, a servant of [Khadijah](Khadijah binti Khuwailid.md). His character, honesty and trustworthiness has caused Khadijah to trust him with a larger of a capital.
Furthermore, his intellect, knowledge and smooth words has caused Nabi Muhammad's investment to return by multiple magnitudes.

This noble character and intellect of Nabi Muhammad had spawned the respect of [Khadijah](Khadijah binti Khuwailid.md) and this relationship had allowed them to be married at the end.

### Prophetization
6 months after Nabi Muhammad visited Gua Hirak multiple times, he got the first message from Allah on 610/08/06 (17 Ramadhan). This message marks the end of [Masyarakat Arab Jahiliah](Masyarakat Arab Jahiliah.md).

## Trivia
The "s.a.w." part of Nabi Muhammad s.a.w. is the shortform of "sallallahu alaihi wassalam" which means blessed by Allah.
