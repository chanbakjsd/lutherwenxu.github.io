# Self-Revision Notes
This section of notes is the result of me doing revision on my own with only a textbook and no other materials.
Points in this section might not be actually relevant in the test but it's a nice to have for actually understanding what's going on.

## Introduction
Most civilization start near rivers like Sungai Tigris, Euphrates, Nil, Indus & Hwang Ho.
Tamadun Islam starts in a hot and dry place ([Hijaz](Hijaz.md)).

Background: Rome and Parsi are being developed at the same time as Tamadun Islam.

## Masyarakat Arab Jahiliah
Jahiliah:
- Originates from Bahasa Arab
- Meaning: Doesn't have knowledge
- Shows how Islam has changed the ways Arab live their life.
  Arab Jahiliah ends when Islam is introduced to [Nabi Muhammad](Nabi Muhammad.md).

Time Period: 300AD ([Maarib Dam](Maarib Dam.md) Failing) - 610AD ([Nabi Muhammad](Nabi Muhammad.md) gets the first notice from Allah)

Reason that they are called knowledgeless: They didn't listen to [other Nabis](Nabi.md) and don't believe in Allah Yang Maha Esa.
Alternative gods at the time:
- Animism (The belief that everything in nature has a spiritual presence)
- Idolatry (Worship an idol)
